## ðŸ“œ Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for details about each release.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.80.0 or higher



## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ohzinteractive/vscode-glb-viewer.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start development mode:
   Inside vscode with the folder open, press F5 to start the extension. This will open a new window with the extension running.
   Under the hood, it will run the `yarn start` command. That builds and watches for changes in the `src/` folder.

### Build

To build the extension:
```bash
yarn build
```

### Packaging

To package the extension into a VSIX file for distribution:

1. Install the VSCE (Visual Studio Code Extensions) tool globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @vscode/vsce
   ```

2. Make sure your extension is built:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

3. Package the extension:
   ```bash
   vsce package
   ```

This will create a `.vsix` file in your project directory. You can then:
- Install it locally by running `code --install-extension ohzi-vscode-glb-viewer-1.0.0.vsix`
- Upload it to the VS Code Marketplace for public distribution
- Share it directly with other users for manual installation

Note: If you plan to publish to the VS Code Marketplace, you'll need to:
1. Create a publisher account on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
2. Get a Personal Access Token (PAT)
3. Login using `vsce login <publisher-name>`
4. Publish using `vsce publish`

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code directory
- `dist/` - Built files
- `extension.js` - Main extension entry point
- `vite.config.mjs` - Vite configuration for building the webview
